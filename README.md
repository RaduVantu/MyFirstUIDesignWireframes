<h2> WorldCraft Online Shopping Website model </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>WorldCraft Limited, a fictional online shopping store, was looking to improve the layout of their existing webpage in order to improve customers experience.</p>
<p>The idea here was to use two Qualitative User Experience research methods to design a new interface for the company website. As such, the User Interview and User Persona research methods were used to determine what changes would be most beneficial and a set of high fidelity wireframes were developed based on the findings.</p>
